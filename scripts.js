// START HERE
// STEP 1. A **hotel** with two properties called **totalRooms** and **bookedRooms**. The values for both properties can be any number. A **remainingRooms()** method (VERSION 2 - ES6) should return the remaining number of rooms that a hotel has. Console.log a message that says, "There are ## of rooms available for booking." The ## in this message should be referenced dynamically from the remainingRooms()method. 
console.log("-------------\n");
console.log("1. Can I book a room?");


// STEP 2. A **Forest Gump** with the property called **"thing"**. The value should be set of chocolates. A **sayQuote()** method (VERSION 2 - Key/Value Pair) will result in a console.log that says "My momma always said, 'Life was like a box of `chocolates`. You never know what you're gonna get.'" The thing "chocolate" in this message should be referenced dynamically from the property. 
console.log("-------------\n");
console.log("2. Oh Forest!");


// STEP 3. A **Instacart** with a property **"items"** initialized to an **empty array**. A method **addItem()** (VERSION 2 - ES6) with one parameter, that will eventually add one item to the items array. Console.log the items property to display the items that are currently in the shopping cart.
console.log("-------------\n");
console.log("3. Instacart");


// STEP 4. A **rocket** with the property called **"name"**. The name of the rocket is called "Apollo 11". A **startLaunch()** method (VERSION 1) will result in a JavaScript **alert** that says, "ignition sequence start for the Apollo 11 ... 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 ..." This method will also console.log a message that says "launched". The name "Apollo 11" in this message should be referenced dynamically from the property. Remember to call the method.
console.log("-------------\n");
console.log("4. We have a liftoff");


// STEP 5. Create your own object and give it **at least one property** and **at least one method**. You can use any version to create the methods, Then call one of the methods you created. Use your imagination! 
console.log("-------------\n");
console.log("5. Create your own!");
